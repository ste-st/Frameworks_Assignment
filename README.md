### Part 5: Documentation and Reflection

During this project, I explored the typical data science workflow:

- I loaded and cleaned a real dataset (CORD-19).

- I performed basic exploration to understand structure and missing values.

- I performed simple analyses (by year, journal, and keywords).

- I created informative visualizations with matplotlib and wordcloud.

- I developed an interactive application in Streamlit to present the results.

Challenges: dealing with very large columns and incomplete data, as well as optimizing file loading.

Learning: hands-on experience with pandas, visualization, and creating basic dashboards.
